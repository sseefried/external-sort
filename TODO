TODO

- Expose Data.ExternalSort.Internal module an refactor tests.
- Use DList to remove uses of "reverse" in readUpToN
- default ExternalSortCfg and justSortTheDamnFileAlready :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()
- have a limit on open file handles and do the merge in multiple passes
- change 'readVal' signature to 'Handle -> IO (Maybe a)'. A Nothing indicates "EOF" and that
  you should stop
- Rename SortTester to SortBench and make deterministic by using using mkStdGen and setStdGen
